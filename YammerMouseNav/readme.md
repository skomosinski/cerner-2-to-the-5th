This is a submission for Cerner's 2018 2^5 programming competition. This year's theme is "Engineering Productivity".

I noticed that my mouse's back/forward navigation buttons did not function in the Microsoft Yammer windows desktop application, so I created an AutoHotKey script to make them work. It simply intercepts the back/forward buttons from the mouse only when Yammer is active, and sends the correct back/forward hot keys to Yammer.

## Getting Started
Run the script and it should begin monitoring your mouse navigation buttons when Yammer is the active window.

## How to use
Use back/forward buttons on your mouse while using Yammer. Simple.

### Prerequisites

 * You will need [AutoHotKey](https://autohotkey.com/) to run the script.
 * Microsoft's [Yammer](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/yammer-for-windows-and-mac-50920c05-cbfc-4f11-8503-e20fb2e623a5?ui=en-US&rs=en-US&ad=US) windows desktop application.
 * A mouse with back/forward buttons.
